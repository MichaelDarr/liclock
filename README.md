This document is a work in progress! It's basically a disorganized scratchpad right now.

## Current Consumption

The MCU (ATtiny44a @ 20MHz) and voltage regulator (MAX5035BUSA+) can be configured to run in a variety of power states. This section explores the current consuption at each.

[^2]: The firmware consistently drives the 6 direct pins low when not writing data to the driver (effectively always). The inverse situation will occur for the two multiplexed pins (CHIP_SELECT_1 and DATA_2), which will nearly always be held high when not writing. This'll even out to a pretty exact 2-pins-high situation.
[^3]: The LCD backplane has a 50% duty cycle. The two LEDs alternate, and the whichever is active will be driven high most of the time (~98%, maybe? These are multiplexed, but these LEDs are the "resting" option targeted by firmware after it utilizes an led-hosting mux).
[^4]: Both activation pins (G1/G2) are tied low (0%), and 50% is a wild guess for the others. This needs more measurement (pg. 3, ACT input load table).

##### I/O Pins

Every pin except VCC (1), XTAL[1..2] (2, 3), PA3 (10) and GND (14) is an I/O pin

[^5]: Each clock refreshes 5 times per second, and each input flips roughly every other character (4 times per 8 characters).
[^6]: 4kHz buzzer buzzing 1% of the time
[^7]: mux_a_1 writes data into the driver latch 8 times per refresh 5 times per second (80 toggles)
[^8]: In addition to toggling char_2 (estimated above as 20Hz), mux_a_2 powers the SW3 pull-up, which is checked maybe 100 times/second? Needs more investigation!
[^9]: mux_b toggles twice per character refresh, switching between lcd drives. It will probably change a good deal to select other mux items. Needs more investigation!. Additionally, it toggles between 

##### Modes

This section describes the baseline power consumption of the MCU, i.e., the cost to hang out in a given mode and just sit there. See pg. 39 on the datasheet for more info.

| Mode       | I‚äÇ‚äÇ   | Description
| :--------- | :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active     | 9mA   | Default "on" state                                                                                 |
| Idle       | 3mA   | CPU stops, but keep other systems (timers, interrupts etc) remain operational.                     |
| Standby    | 80ŒºA  | "Power-down" but keep the oscillator running, allowing the MCU to be woken up in six clock cycles. |
| Power-down | 0.4ŒºA | Lowest functionality level of short of yanking power, nearly everything is stopped.                |

The initial build will include a physical on/off switch to toggle the voltage regulator's ON/OFF pin between GND and V·µ¢‚Çô. This OFF state will be used in place of standby or power-down. This approach has a couple significant benefits:

* Every IC (except the regulator itself) is will be fully disabled when the device is off.
* The MCU doesn't have to meddle at all with the battery or voltage voltage regulator, saving pins as well as complication.

In a future build, liclock could be built without a physical switch - further investigation & measurement is needed



### Active Mode

TODO: Calculate pin current draw (pg. 188, voltage * load capacitance * average switching frequency of the I/O pin)

| Consumer                  | Typ   | Max   |
| :------------------------ | :---- | :---- |
| MCU in Active Mode        | 9mA   | 11mA  |
| MCU Pins                  | ?mA   | ?mA   |
| IC Quiescent Current      | 289ŒºA | 580ŒºA |
| LEDs (2x alterating = 1x) | 12mA  | 12mA  |

### Power-down Mode

Power-down is the MCU's deepest sleep mode; it's the next-best thing to pulling the cord.

* The MCU's consumption drops to ~0.4ŒºA, and it can only be be woken by the watchdog or by an external interrupt.
* Voltage is still being supplied to all ICs, so quiescent current their qu but at least the LEDs are off.

### Standby

Current consumption standby mode is .
